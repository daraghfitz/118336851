    <h1>My Interests</h1>
        <h4>Rugby</h4>
        <p>Rugby is my main interest and my favourite sport. I play for UCC RFC seniors. I am a tighthead prop. I have played for Munster u18 and u19.<br>
        I also love watching rugby games. I am a season ticket holder with Munster and go to Thomond Park to watch all of their Champions Cup games and I've travelled to Edinburgh, Exeter, Belfast and Montpellier to watch them play.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Barbecues</h4>
        <p>I love having barbecues in the summer with my friends and family. I enjoy cooking various meats on my barbecue. I often cook with the barbecue in the winter also as I think meat tastes nicer when barbecued. My favourite meat is brisket (beef) and sirloin.</p>
